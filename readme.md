# Final Project for LING 5801

To get started:

First install a virtualenv and activate it: 
```
python -m venv venv
```

On Windows:
```
.venv/Scripts/activate
```
On Linux: 
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

For speed, use Linux (WSL if on Windows). PyTorch does not support GPU on Windows.

```
pip install requirements.txt
